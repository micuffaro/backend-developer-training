# Pre-requisites

Start with the following:
- Install a text editor.
vscode is an excellent choice: [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
notepad++ is another one: [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- Create an account on [Github](https://github.com/).
Github is a platform where you can publish your code.
We will be using  it to share/review code

# Computer science course

We want to get you up to speed with fundamental concepts about how computers work.
The absolute best place to start is the excellent CS50 free course from Harvard college.

https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/

This course is done at your own pace. You have a series of 11 university level lectures, along with labs, problem sets and projects
that you need to complete. You can also get a certificate at the end.

If you spend an hour or so every day on it, it should take you about 3 months to complete the whole course.
The program is hard, but definitely doable, even if you have never programmed before. By the end of it, you will have a pretty good foundation that you will find vitally useful in your future career as a software developer.

Start from week 0 (programming with Scratch); Watch the lecture, and try to complete all of the labs, all of the problems and projects on your own.
Take plenty of notes. The teacher goes really fast so if you don't understand something make sure to take a break, rewind and ensure you understood things. If you didn't, write down your questions and let me know.

I've gone through the course before and can definitely help you out when stuck, especially in the later weeks of the course.

# Coding practice

Once you complete Week 6 of the above course, which teaches you about Python, we can start some coding practice.
Register on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/), and complete the "Hello world" exercises for C and Python programming languages.
Then you can start solving the exercises on there at your own pace (there's a lot of them, you can just complete them when you feel like practicing).
Exercism is great because it has plenty of coding problems, but especially because you have volunteers that are there to provide you with feedback on your code. Code reviews are extremely important in this field, and this is a great opportunity to practice giving and receiving them.

Keep working also on the harvard course until you're done with Week 10

# Git + Github tutorials

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) and get acquainted with both git and github

# Projects

By this point you will need to submit a final project for the Harvard course, in order to complete it.
We can discuss any ideas on what to create, and we'll act accordingly.

# Networking
# Containerization
